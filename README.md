# Roberts FOSS Software
A list of daily driver and software recommendations for those who want to be less dependant on a single company, use FOSS software or looking for alternatives to proprietary software on Linux and other platforms.

This list is purely my own opinion and changes over time with my experience and usage. It will expand as needed and typically includes a couple of options for various categories.

Items with a :blue_car: are my daily drivers.

Items with a :floppy_disk: are my alternative/backup software.

### Video Editors:

#### :blue_car: Davinci Resolve

Reason:
Its free, studio quality and for 99% of free users handles literally all you could ask for in a video production environment.

#### :floppy_disk: Kdenlive

Reason:
Free and open source. It is also very lightweight and functions well. Made some great progress in the years and when i have updates to Resolve or using my lighter weight ARM based Laptop this works a treat.
